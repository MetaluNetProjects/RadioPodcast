# Radio Podcast

1950's vintage radio turned to a podcast player.

The wav-files must reside in an USB drive, in 5 directories named:
PU/ GO/  PO/  BE/  OC/

About 30 files per directory is fine.
They will appear in alphabetical order, from left to right.

The USB drive is rescanned when the power switch is turned off.
